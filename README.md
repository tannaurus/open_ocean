# open_ocean
A 4 day hackathon in the Bevy game engine

# Playing
- To run the game, `cargo run`
- `W` and `S` increase speed and decrease speed (lower and raise sails), respectively.
- `A` and `D` to turn left and right. You can turn faster the faster you're moving. 🏴‍☠️
- `Q` to fire the left cannons, `E` the fire the right cannons. Cannos need a moment to reload.
- `Esc` to pause the game.

# Not implemented
- Ememies don't do anything
- No health system, despite the code suggesting there is 😄
